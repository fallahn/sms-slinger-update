<h3><b>Getting Started:</b></h3>
<p>
Throughout the rest of these tutorials you will notice that the SMS 
deals in bytes and words. Unfortunately there are no standard keywords 
in C++ for
these basic types, however there are other primitive types that are a 
byte and a word in size. A "char" is a byte and a "short" is a word. 
However my personal
opinion is that having the type "char" when dealing with registers just 
seems wrong so you will notice I've typedef'd them as BYTE and WORD. On 
the rare occasion
that I needed a signed byte and a signed word I typedef'd them as 
SIGNED_BYTE and SIGNED_WORD respectively <br><br>

</p><p class="block"> 
typedef unsigned char BYTE;<br>
typedef unsigned short int WORD;<br>
typedef signed short int SIGNED_WORD;<br>
typedef signed char SIGNED_BYTE;
</p>



<p></p>


<h3><b>ROM Files:</b></h3>
<p>

The largest known SMS game is 1 mega byte (equivelant to 0x100000 
bytes). This is easily small enough for us to load the entire rom in at 
the start of our emulation. In the next section of the tutorials I will 
explain indepth the
internal memory structure of the SMS. However for now I need to briefly 
touch on the read only memory inside the SMS.<br><br>

The SMS memory has at the beginning space for 0xC000 bytes of ROM 
memory. This is obviously too small to fit the larger ROMS into, 
remember the maximum ROM size is 0x100000 which is considerably bigger 
than 0xC000. Like most
gaming systems the SMS pages in and out memory that it needs when it 
needs it. Each page is 0x4000 bytes and as there is space for 0xC000 
bytes of game memory there is enough room for 3 pages (0xc000/0x4000 = 
3). When the SMS is loaded
the first 3 pages of the ROM file is loaded into the internal SMS 
memory. We will deal with the memory paging in the next section of the 
tutorials. However for now it is worth knowing that the smallest ROM 
file is 32k which is only 2 pages (0x8000 bytes)
so this will fit into the first 0xC000 with room to spare. This means 
that ROMS that are 32k in size do not need to do memory paging. I 
recommend you start your SMS emulation journey like I did with 32k ROMs.<br><br>

When using a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive ROM dumping program some of them 
put a 512 header onto the beginning of the ROM. This needs to be 
stripped off otherwise the ROM wont work because all the memory will be 
in the wrong location. The way to detect if the ROM
has the header attached to it is to modulus the size of the ROM with 
0x4000 and if the answer is 512 then we need to remove the first 512 
bytes from the ROM.<br><br>

Below is the declarations of the variables used with ROM loading:

</p><p class="code">

BYTE m_InternalMemory[0x10000] ;<br>
BYTE m_GameMemory[0x100000] ; <br>
bool m_IsCodeMasters ; <br>
bool m_OneMegCartridge ;
</p> 

Putting all of this information together we can load in a ROM file like so:<br><br>

<p class="code">
void Emulator::InsertRom(const char* filename)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; memset(m_InternalMemory,0,sizeof(m_InternalMemory)) ;<br>
&nbsp; memset(m_GameMemory,0,sizeof(m_GameMemory)) ; <br><br>

&nbsp; FILE *in = NULL;<br><br>

&nbsp; // get the file size<br>
&nbsp; in = fopen( filename, "rb" );<br>
&nbsp; fseek( in, 0L, SEEK_END );<br>
&nbsp; long endPos = ftell( in );<br>
&nbsp; fclose(in);<br><br>

&nbsp; in = fopen( filename, "rb" );<br><br>

&nbsp; endPos = endPos % 0x4000 ;<br><br>

&nbsp; if (endPos == 512)<br>
&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; // we need to strip off the header<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; char header[1000] ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (endPos == 512) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; fread(header,1,512,in) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; }<br><br>

&nbsp; size_t size = fread(m_CartridgeMemory, 1, 0x100000, in);<br>
&nbsp; m_OneMegCartridge = (endPos &gt; 0x80000)?true:false ;<br><br>
	
&nbsp; // copy the first 3 pages from cartridge memory to internal memory<br>
&nbsp; memcpy(&amp;m_InternalMemory[0x0], &amp;m_CartridgeMemory[0x0], 0xC000) ;<br><br>

&nbsp; m_IsCodeMasters = IsCodeMasters() ;<br>
}

</p>

You will notice that we store in the variable m_OneMegCartridge if the 
ROM is 1mb in size. We need to know this for memory paging as you will 
see
in the next section. We also need to know if the ROM is a codemasters 
game, as discussed below.

<p></p>

<h3><b>CodeMasters ROM Files:</b></h3>
<p>
CodeMasters games use their own memory mapper so we need to know if a 
ROM is a CodeMasters game or not. Now this is again something I wish to 
talk about in the next section of tutorials but
in order to determine if a ROM is a CodeMasters ROM we need to check 
when we are loading in the ROM. There maybe many ways to detect if a ROM
 is a CodeMasters ROM or not but the way I've done it is by inspecting 
the header of the ROM.<br>
A CodeMasters ROM header has a checksum part of it so if we compute the 
checksum and it all works ok then we have a CodeMasters game. The way 
the checksum works is by combining memory address 0x7fe7 and 0x7fe6 to 
form a 16 bit number. If this
16 bit number when taken away from 0x10000 is equal to the 16 bit number
 formed from memory address 0x7fe9 and 0x7fe8 then we have a codemasters
 game.

</p><p class="code">

bool Emulator::IsCodeMasters( ) const <br>
{ <br>
&nbsp; WORD checksum = m_InternalMemory[0x7fe7] &lt;&lt; 8 ;<br>
&nbsp; checksum |= m_InternalMemory[0x7fe6] ;<br><br>

&nbsp; if (checksum == 0x0)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; return false ;<br><br>

&nbsp; WORD compute = 0x10000 - checksum ; <br><br>

&nbsp; WORD answer = m_InternalMemory[0x7fe9] &lt;&lt; 8 ;<br>
&nbsp; answer |= m_InternalMemory[0x7fe8] ;<br><br>

&nbsp; return compute == answer ;
}

</p>


<p></p>

<h3><b>Main emulation loop:</b></h3>
<p>

Now we have our ROM image loaded into memory we can start the emulation 
process. I have already shown you the code for the emulation loop in the
 "The Hardware" section of the SMS tutorials. I shall show it again here
but this time I shall add where we check for interupts.

</p><p class="code">
// this is responsible for emulating one frame<br>
void Emulator::Update( )<br>
{ <br>
&nbsp; const double MACHINE_CLICKS_PER_FRAME = 10738580 / 60 ; <br>

&nbsp; unsigned int clicksThisUpdate = 0 ;<br><br>

&nbsp; // emulate 1/60th of a seconds amount of machine clicks<br>
&nbsp; while (clicksThisUpdate &lt; MACHINE_CLICKS_PER_FRAME) <br>
&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; int z80ClockCycles = m_Z80.ExecuteNextInst(); <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; HandleInterrupts( ) ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // the machine clock is 3 times faster than the z80 clock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; int machineClicks = z80ClockCycles * 3 ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // the vdp clock is half the speed of the machine clock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; float vdpCycles = machineClicks / 2 ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // the sound clock is the same speed as the z80<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; int soundCycles = z80ClockCycles ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; m_VDP.Update(vdpCycles) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Sound.Update(soundCycles) ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; clicksThisUpdate += machineClicks ;<br>
&nbsp; }<br>

}

</p>

I shall implement the new function called HandleInterrupts in the 
"Interrupts" section to the SMS tutorials. It is important to handle 
interrupts after the z80 instruction execution
but before the VDP update otherwise some games wont work. After days of 
debugging I found this was the problem with the game "XENON 2". The 
fault lies with the game expecting an interrupt
at a specific point and if things happen out of sequence then anything 
could go wrong.<br><br>

Now the main emulation loop is in place all thats left to do is 
implement those functions it calls which will be a lot of work. Before 
we start implementing those functions we will next look
at memory management.<br><br>
