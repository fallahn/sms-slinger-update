<p> Sega Master System - Sound.</p>

<div id="main">

<h3><b>PSG Info:</b></h3>
<p>

The PSG is a SN79489 made by Texas Instruments. This sound chip has 4 
different channels, three of which are tone channels and the remaining 
is a noise channel. It outputs sounds using square waves which is 
discussed later. This means that it can be programmed to change the 
volume of each channel as well as the frequency each channel is set to. 
To change the volumes and frequency of the channels data is written to 
port 0x7F which is also mirrored at 0x7E.<br><br>

The PSG clock is the same as the Z80 processor clock which is three 
times slower than the main system clock. Each channel has a counter 
which is set to its frequency. Every 224KhZ each channels counter is 
decremented and then the output of all the channels are combined and 
added to the playback buffer. When one of the counters reaches 0 then it
 is reset to the value of the channels frequency and the polarity of the
 output for this channel is changed. This is the basics of square waves.

</p>

<h3><b>Square Waves:</b></h3>
<p>
Square Waves get their name because the output from the channels is 
always one of two values, this is known as the channels current 
polarity. Signed square waves output values of +1 and -1 and unsigned 
square waves output +1 and 0. The essence of unsigned square waves and 
signed square waves are the same but I decided to use signed square 
waves as combining the outputs of all 4 channels is just a case of 
adding them together, which is easier than unsigned square waves. The 
reason why outputting only two values from the channels is a square wave
 is because the wave pattern looks square. For example if the frequency 
of channel1 was set to 5 then this is how many 224kHz sample are played 
on each half of the square wave. So 5 224Khz samples are played at one 
of the polarity and then another 5 224khz samples are played at the 
other polarity. This results in a 10 224khz samples being played every 
full wave. The diagram below helps illustrate this.

</p><p class="block">
1&nbsp;&nbsp;	
|#####&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#####&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#####<br>
0&nbsp;&nbsp;	|-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
-1&nbsp;		
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#####&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#####&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#####

</p>

As you can see if the frequency was set to 5 then, 5 samples are ouput 
at polarity 1 and then 5 samples are output at polarity -1. This is why 
it is known as a square wave because as you can see the pattern of the 
wave has square edges. Each channels output (+1 or -1) is multiplied by 
its volume to get its playback data. All 4 channels playback data are 
then added together (because we are using signed square waves) and this 
is the final playback data which is then added to the playback buffer. 

<p></p>

<h3><b>PSG Registers:</b></h3>
<p>
Each of the 4 channels have 2 registers associated with it, which means 
there are 8 registers in total. The first channel register is the volume
 of the channel which is a 4 bit register, the second register is the 
tone register of the channel (its frequency), these are 10 bit registers
 with the exception of the noise channel which is 4 bits.<br><br>

When I refer to channel0 im referring to the first channel of the 4, 
when I refer to channel1 im referring to the second channel etc. The 
reason is when the data is written to the PSG the channel it is intended
 for it is represented in binary as 00,01,10 and 11.

The volume registers are set to 0xF on starup and tone registers are set
 to 0x0.

</p>

<h3><b>PSG channel volume:</b></h3>
<p>

Although the volume registers are 8 bits the lower 4 bits are only ever 
used meaning the volume has a range of 0x0 to 0xF. 0x0 means full volume
 and 0xF means silence. Each volume value gets quieter by 2 decibels so 
volume 0x1 is 2 decibels quieter than 0x0 and volume 0x2 is 2 decibels 
quieter than 0x1. As I mentioned in the square wave section we are 
outputting value of +1 and -1 from the channels which is then multiplied
 by the channels volume and this value for all 4 channels get added 
together and added to the playback buffer. It is essential that the 
value added to the playback buffer does not overflow the maximum and 
minium values. The most common value type for the playback buffer are 
signed 16 bit samples. The minimum and maximum values for a signed 16 
bit number is -32768 to +32767 respectively. This means that when 
combining the playback values for all 4 channels the value cannot exceed
 these values. Because we are adding the 4 channels playback values 
together then we can gaurentee we dont exceed these values by having a 
maximum channel volume 0f 8000. This means that if all 4 channels were 
outputting at maximum volume and they were all outputting at positive 
polarity then they would all output playback volumes of 8000 and when 
combined together would give a maximum playback value of 32000 which is 
within the 32767 range. Similary is all channels were on full volume and
 all the channels polarity was negative then they would all output a 
playback value of -8000 so when combined together would give a playback 
value of -32000 which fits within the -32768 range. This will gaurentee 
whatever the polarity of the channels and whatever their volumes the 
combined playback value of the channel will never exceed the maximum or 
minimum range.<br><br>

When we create our emulated PSG chip we need to setup our volume table 
which is what we will use to know what to multiply the channels output 
by to get the correct volume. As stated earlier volume 0x0 is the 
maximum volume and volume 0xF is the minimum volume. Each volume value 
is less then the previous by 2decibels. This will setup our volume table
 like so:

</p><p class="code">
const int MAXVOLUME = 8000 ; <br>
const float twodb = 0.8f ;<br><br>

float currentVolume = MAXVOLUME ; <br>
for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; NUMVOLUMES; i++)<br>
{ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_VolumeTable[i] = currentVolume ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; currentVolume *= twodb; <br>
} <br><br>

m_VolumeTable[0xF] = 0; // silence

</p>

The definition of m_VolumeTable is:

<p class="code">
const int NUMVOLUMES = 16 ; // 16 possible values from the 4 bit volume registers<br> 
WORD m_VolumeTable[NUMVOLUMES] ;
</p>

<p></p>

<h3><b>Writing data to the PSG:</b></h3>
<p>
As stated eariler the game writes sound data to the PSG via ports 0x7F 
and 0x7E. The PSG has a latch which is the current register where the 
data byte is designed for. The initially latched register is channel0s 
tone register. The data byte written takes one of two forms. The first 
form changes the current latched register and updates its data. The 
second form is data intended to be written to the currently latched 
register. The following is how the 2 different data typed should be 
interpreted: <br><br>

Type1:  1ccrdddd<br>
Type2:  0xdddddd<br><br>

As you can see the two data bytes can be identified by the value of bit7.<br><br>

Type1:<br>
If the data byte being written to the PSG port has bit 7 set then this 
is how the data should be interpreted. Firstly this data byte is 
designed to update the currently latched register and then update its 
data. Bits 6 and 5 combined show which channel needs to be latched and 
bit 4 is whether you need to latch a volume or tone register. A value of
 1 means a volume register and a value of 0 means a tone register. The 
remaining 4 bits are the data that updates the LOWER four bits of the 
newly latched register. So if the newly latched register is a volume 
register then the lower 4 bits of the 8 bit register is updated whilst 
the top 4 bits are left unchanged. However if a tone register is latched
 then the bottom 4 bits of the 10 bit register is updated leaving the 
higher 6 bits unchanged except with the noise register as this register 
is only 4 bits so the entire register is updated.<br><br>

Type2:<br>
If the currently latched register is a tone register then the lower 6 
bits of the data byte is used to update the higher 6 bits of the 10 bit 
register leaving the lower 4 bits unchanged. The exception is again with
 the noise register as this register is only 4 bits so the lower 4 bits 
of the data byte completely update the 4 bit noise register.<br>
If the currently latched register is a volume register then then lower 4
 bits of the data byte update the lower 4 bits of the 8 bit volume 
register.<br><br>

To help keep the contents of this page managable my emulation code for 
this section of the PSG emulation has been added to a text file rather 
than clutter this page as it is a large piece of code. Please click <a href="http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/mastersystem/snippet_psg_write.txt">here</a>
 to view the code snippet. This code snippet should be self explanatory 
with the exception of the variable m_LFSR which I will explain in the 
noise channel section on this page. This code snippet uses 4 member 
variables that I have yet to exaplain, these are m_Tones, m_Volume, 
m_LatchedChannel, m_IsToneLatched. These are defined as:

</p><p class="code">
bool m_IsToneLatched ;<br>
BYTE m_LatchedChannel; <br>
WORD m_Tones[4] ; <br>
BYTE m_Volumes[4] ;
</p>

m_LatchedChannel is the idenitifier of the currently latched channel. If
 it is 0 then the currently latched channel is the first channel 
(channel0). If it is 1 then the currently latched channel is the second 
channel (channel1). If it is 3 then the currently latched channel is the
 noise channel (channel3), this is what the constant TONES_NOISE is set 
to.<br>
m_IsToneLatched is a boolean variable to identify if the currently 
latched channel has its tone register latched or its volume register.<br>
The tone registers are 10 bits and as there are 4 channels this gives 
the definition of m_Tones. This register simply stores the sample 
frequency of each channel.<br>
m_Volumes is the same as m_Tones except for the 8 bit volume registers.

<p></p>

<h3><b>PSG Tone Playback:</b></h3>
<p>

Now we have all the channels set correctly from emulating the psg writes
 we can now start playing sound. I have already explained how the psg 
creates sound using square waves so this is the implementation of the 
playback emulation. Because the noise channel works differently from the
 first three channels I shall discuss the implementation of the noise 
channel later on. For now I'll emulate the first three channels. There 
are a few variables used in this code snippet that I have yet to define.
 <br><br>

Variable m_Polarity which holds each channels polarity which will be either 1 or -1.It is initially set to 1 for each channel. <br>
m_Counters which originally get sets to the variables frequency and 
counts down to 0. When it reaches 0 the polarity is changed and the 
counter is reset back to that channels frequency.<br>
m_CurrentPosition is where the playback data goes into the 
playbackbuffer array. When the sound card requests our playback buffer 
this variable gets set back to 0.<br>
m_PlaybackBuffer this is the buffer the sound card will request to play. 

</p><p class="code">
BYTE m_Polarity[4] ;<br>
int m_Counters[4] ; <br>
int m_CurrentPosition ; <br>
signed int m_PlaybackBuffer[1024] ;
</p>

The reason why the playback buffer has 1024 elements is because I use 
the SDL audio library and this is how large I told it my playback buffer
 was so it knows how frequently to request the buffer.<br><br>

<p class="code">
void SN79489::Playback( float cyclesMac )<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; int floor = 0 ;<br>
&nbsp; if (NotTimeToUpdate(cyclesMac,floor)) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; return ; <br><br>

&nbsp; // tone playback<br>
&nbsp; signed short int tone = 0 ;<br><br>
	
&nbsp; for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; 3; i++)<br>
&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (m_Tones[i] == 0)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Counters[i]-= floor;<br><br>		

&nbsp;&nbsp; if (m_Counters[i] &lt;= 0) // time to change polarity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Counters[i] = m_Tones[i] ; // reset counter <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Polarity[i] *= -1 ; // change polarity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; tone += m_VolumeTable[m_Volume[i]] * m_Polarity[i] ;<br>
&nbsp; }<br><br>

&nbsp; signed short int noiseTone = 0 ;<br>
&nbsp; // code goes here to get noise output<br>
&nbsp; m_PlaybackBuffer[m_CurrentPosition] = tone + noiseTone ;<br>
&nbsp; m_CurrentPosition++ ;<br>

}
</p>

You will notice that sound does not get generated when the tone is set 
to 0. Hopefully all the above code is clear. I have left a comment where
 the code to get the noise channel ouput goes. The function 
NotTimeToUpdate makes sure
that the playbackbuffer gets updated only every 224khz. If it returns 
false then no data is calculated, however if it returns true then the 
"floor" variable
gets set to how many cycles the counters need to get decremented by.

<p></p>

<h3><b>PSG Noise Playback:</b></h3>
<p>
The noise playback slightly differs to the playback of the other three 
channels. Although a counter is used to change the polarity of the noise
 channel, instead of feeding this output straight to the playback buffer
 like the other channels this output is used as an input to a linear 
feedback shift register to generate noise. The noise channel either 
generate white noise or periodic noise based on the value bit 2 of the 
noise register. If the value is 1 then white noise is generated 
otherwise periodic noise is generated. The linear feedback shift 
register is a 16bit array which has its bit shifted either left or right
 (it doesnt matter) everytime the polarity changes from -1 to 1 (at the 
end of a full square wave). The bit shifted out of the array is then 
used as input into a mixer. <br><br>

I now refer you to maxims guide on the details of noise generation as he explains it better than I ever could. <a href="http://www.smspower.org/dev/docs/#Sound">LINK</a>
<br><br>

The following is my implementation of Maxims noise generation:

</p><p class="code">

if (m_Tones[TONES_NOISE] != 0)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; m_Counters[TONES_NOISE] -= floor ;<br><br>
		
&nbsp; if (m_Counters[TONES_NOISE] &lt;= 0)<br>
&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; // the last 2 bits of the noise register contain a freq lookup<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; WORD freq = m_Tones[TONES_NOISE] ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; freq &amp;= 0x3 ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // reset the noise counter <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; int count = 0 ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; switch(freq)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0: count = 0x10; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 1: count = 0x20; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 2: count = 0x40; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 3: count = m_Tones[CHANNEL_TWO]; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Counters[TONES_NOISE] = count ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Polarity[TONES_NOISE] *= -1 ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // if the polarity changed from -1 to 1 then shift the random number<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (m_Polarity[TONES_NOISE] == 1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool isWhiteNoise = TestBit(m_Tones[TONES_NOISE],2) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE tappedBits = BitGetVal( m_Tones[TONES_NOISE], 0) ; ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tappedBits |= (BitGetVal( m_Tones[TONES_NOISE], 3) &lt;&lt; 3);<br><br>
				
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_LFSR =(m_LFSR&gt;&gt;1) | ((isWhiteNoise?parity(m_LFSR&amp;tappedBits):m_LFSR&amp;1)&lt;&lt;15);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; }<br><br>

&nbsp; noiseTone = m_VolumeTable[m_Volume[TONES_NOISE]] * (m_LFSR &amp; 1) ;<br>
	
}


</p>

The above code is placed in the Playback function I gave in the previous
 section on this page where the "code goes here to get noise output" 
comment is. The parity function returns 1 if the data has an even number
 of on bits, or 0 if it has
an odd number if on bits.


<p></p>

<h3><b>PSG Timing:</b></h3>
<p>
I have said before that the playback function needs to be called at a 
rate of 224khz. If it is not called at the correct speed then although 
the tune being
played will sound correct the tone of the notes will be incorrect. This 
is what the function NotTimeToUpdate is used for. I use this to 
calculate if it is
time to update the playback buffer and reduce the channel counters. The 
variable "floor" is set to the number that the counters needed to be 
reduced by. 
It is almost impossible to call the playback function at exactly 224khz 
so you must make sure that you keep the precision. 
This is why floor is an int because although I lose the floating point 
precision by flooring it to an int, I still keep the float value and 
take it into consideration next time I call the playback function.
You will notice that the playback function has an argument for the 
amount of machineCycles that have been executed since the last time the 
function was called. As I said earlier the PSG clock is 
three times slower than the machine clock to the NoTimeToUpdate function
 immediately divides this value by 3. However the PSG runs at a rate 16 
times slower than its clock so this value must then by divided by 16.
</p>

<h3><b>Playing the playback buffer</b></h3>
<p>
There are a few ways which you can play the playback buffer. Some of 
these ways are DirectSound, OpenAl or using the SDL sound library. I 
personally went for the SDL sound library and am happy with the results.
 I shall leave the decision of choosing which API up to you like I did 
with the graphic rendering. If you decide to go with the SDL library 
then look into the structure SDL_AudioSpec. If you are still having 
issues look at how I use it by downloading my source code, which can be 
found on the "Finished Project" link to the right of this page.
