<p> Sega Master System - Interrupts.</p>

<div id="main">

<h3><b>Interrupts:</b></h3>
<p>

There are three different interrupt mechinisms the Z80 can use but the SMS only uses one of them (interrupt mode 1).<br><br>

The sega master system has 3 hardware interrupts. A hardware interrupt 
is a way that the a piece of hardware can signal the CPU to stop doing 
what it is currently doing and start doing something else. It is a way
of achieving multitasking. There are two types of interrupts, maskable 
interrupts and none-maskable interrupts. The difference is that you can 
disable maskable interrupts from interrupting the CPU but you cannot 
stop a none maskable interrupt.
Whenever a none maskable interrupt occurs the CPU will stop doing what 
its doing and service it. An interrupt gets serviced by the CPU pushing 
its current program counter on to the stack and jumping to the address 
of the Interrupt Handler. When it has finished
servicing the interrupt handler it will set its program counter back to 
what it was before the interrupt occurred and then carry on where it 
left off.<br><br>

</p>

<h3><b>Maskable Interrupts:</b></h3>
<p>
The Z80 has two interrupt status flip flops which I will call FF1 and 
FF2. If FF1 is set then maskable interrupts are enabled and can be 
signalled at any time. When FF1 is not set then the maskable interrupts 
will not get serviced until FF1 becomes set. However
it is important to know that if FF1 is not set and an interrupt is being
 requested, by the time FF1 becomes set again that same interrupt may no
 longer be requesting to be serviced so that interrupt would never have 
got serviced. Before I explain what FF2 does i'll mention
that a none maskable interrupt always takes priority over a maskable 
interrupt. So when a none maskable interrupt is signalled FF1 is set to 
off so no maskable interrupts can interrupt the current servicing of the
 none maskable interrupt. When a none maskable interrupt is signalled
FF2 becomes the value of FF1 and FF1 is set to off. This way when the 
none maskable interrupt finishes and returns with a Z80 RETI instruction
 FF1 is set back to what it was before the none maskable interrupt was 
serviced which is the value of FF2. The following shows how the Z80 
instructions affect
the flip flops:<br><br>

EI (enable interrupts): FF1 = on and FF2 = on <br>
DI (disable interrupts): FF1 = off and FF2 = off<br>
RETI (return from interrupt routine): FF1 = FF2  <br><br>

Actually EI doesnt change the value of FF1 and FF2 to "on" until the instruction after EI. <br><br>

There are two maskable interrupts that can occur in the SMS and they are
 both signaled from the VDP. The first interrupt is the vertical sync 
interrupt. This occurs when the V counter first moves out of the active 
display area to the none active display area. As discussed in the VDP 
section
of these tutorials when this happens a bit in the VDP status register is
 set showing the VDP is requesting an interrupt. However it will only 
request an interrupt if vertical sync interrupts are enabled in the 
appropriate VDP register, this also was discussed and implemented in the
 VDP section. <br><br>

The second maskable interrupt is the line counter. The game can set the 
line counter to any value whilst the vdp is outside of the active 
display period (except the first line of the none active display 
period). When the vdp is in the active display period (also the first 
line of the none active display period) the line counters value is 
decremented each time the v counter moves onto the next line. When the 
line counters
value goes less than 0 then its value is reset to what it started at and
 a line interrupt is requested. All this was discussed in more detail in
 the VDP section of these tutorials.<br><br>

One important difference between the vsync interrupt and the line 
interrupt is that the vsync interrupt will constantly request to be 
serviced whilst the vsync bit is set in the vdp status register and 
vsync interrupts are enabled in the appropriate vdp register. However 
with a line interrupt it is requested once
and forgotten about until it occurs again.<br><br>

The VDP can keep requesting interrupts but until FF1 is set to "on" then
 none of them will get serviced. When an interrupt has been accepted for
 being serviced (FF1 is on) then the current program counter is pushed 
onto the stack and the program counter is set to 0x38 which is the 
address of the interrupt handling routine.

</p>

<h3><b>None Maskable Interrupts:</b></h3>
<p>

There is only one none maskable interrupt called the "Reset Interrupt". 
This occurs when the player pushes the reset button on the control pad. 
The way to emulate this is to have a boolean variable (from here on 
referred to as m_ResetInterrupt) which is set to true when the reset 
button is pushed, and then the main emulation loop should check this 
variable
after every instruction it emulates. As previously mentioned you cannot 
turn off none maskable interrupts and they have a higher priority than 
maskable interrupts. When a none maskable interrupt is signalled the CPU
 pushes its program counter on to the stack and jumps to the interrupt 
handler for the none maskable interrupt which is address 0x66.

</p>

<h3><b>Handling Interrupts:</b></h3>
<p>

In the "Getting Started" section of these tutorials I mentioned that I 
still need to implement the HandleInterrupts function in the main 
emulation loop. Now we have armed ourselves with all the information 
needed for implementing this function we can finally do it:

</p><p class="code">

void Emulator::HandleInterrupts()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; if (m_ResetInterrupt &amp;&amp; !m_ServicingReset)<br>
&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_ServicingReset = true ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_ResetInterrupt = false ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; FF1 = false ; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Halted = false ; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; PushWordOntoStack(m_ProgramCounter) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_ProgramCounter = 0x66 ;<br>
&nbsp; }<br><br>

&nbsp; if (m_GraphicsChip.IsRequestingInterupt())<br>
&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (FF1 &amp;&amp; m_InteruptMode == 1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Halted = false ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PushWordOntoStack(m_ProgramCounter) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_ProgramCounter = 0x38 ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_IFF1 = false ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_IFF2 = false ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp; }<br>
}
</p>

Remember that the game can sit and wait for an interrupt to happen by 
calling the HALT instruction. This means no other instruction will be 
executed until an interrupt occurs. This is why we
set the m_Halted variable back to false so the cpu can then start 
executing instructions again. You will have also noticed that I have an 
extra boolen variable called m_ServicingReset. This simply stops another
 reset interrupt from occuring whilst
a previous reset interrupt is currently being serviced.<br><br>
