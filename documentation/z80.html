<p> Sega Master System - Z80.</p>

</div>

<div id="main">

<h3><b>Z80 Info:</b></h3>
<p>

The z80 is an 8 bit microprocessor which is used in many early video 
game systems (and many other systems). It has 8 standard registers, 8 
shadow registers, 2 index registers, 1 refresh register and an interrupt
 vector register. It also has a stack, program counter and 8 flags (only
 6 of which are used in the SMS Z80).<br><br>

<u>The Registers</u><br>
The 8 standard registers are named A,B,C,D,E,F,H,L. All are 8 bits and have different uses.

</p><p class="block">
A: Accumulator<br>
B: General Purpose<br>
C: General Purpose<br>
D: General Purpose<br>
E: General Purpose<br>
F: Flag Register<br>
H: Address register<br>
L: Address register
</p>


However these registers can also be paired to form 4 sets of 16 bit 
registers. The pairings are AF, BC, DE, HL. It is more common for 
registers H and L to be used as a pair than as two seperate registers 
because the z80 address space is 16 bits.<br><br>

Althrough these registers have different uses we dont need to worry 
about using them because it will be the ROM that uses them, we just need
 to know which one is being used and the z80 instructions tell us this. 
The only register we need to work with is the flag register. When 
emulating the z80 instructions we need to check which flags (if any) the
 instruction affects and then make sure the flag register gets set 
accordingly.<br><br>

There are also 8 shadow registers named A',B',C',D',E',F',H',L'. These 
registers can also be paired to form 4 sets of 16 bit registers 
AF',BC',DE',HL'. These registers cannot be modified directly by any z80 
instruction. Their purpose is to be exchanged with their corresponding 
standard registers. So if register pair AF value was 0xABCD and register
 pair AF' value was 0x1234 then using an exchange instruction would swap
 the values so AF is 0x1234 and AF' is 0xABCD. The programmer would 
carry on using the AF registers through the Z80 instructions so the AF 
value would no longer be 0x1234 and then they can exchange the registers
 back so AF gets set back to its original value 0xABCD. Once again you 
do not need to worry about the details of the use of these shadow 
registers. Just make sure you emulate the exchange instructions 
correctly.<br><br>

The refresh register is a counter that gets incrememented each time an 
opcode is fetched (including opcode prefixes which I'll explain later). 
The purpose of this register is usually to generate random numbers.<br><br>

The interrupt register works with interrupt mode 2 which as I explain 
later is not used in the SMS so you do not need to emulate this<br><br>

The two index registers IX and IY are used with two opcode prefixes 
(explained later) which replaces the registers H and L in instructions 
which use registers HL. For example ADD HL, HL would become ADD IX,IX 
for one opcode prefix and ADD IY,IY for ther other. When an instruction 
uses HL for memory accress (represented by (HL)) then an 8bit immediate 
offset is added to registers IX and IY. This will all be explained 
later.
<br><br>
<u>The Flags</u><br>
Each bit in the 8 bit flag register (except bits 5 and 3 which arent used) represents a flag:

<p class="block">
Bit 7 = (S)Sign Flag<br>
Bit 6 = (Z)Zero Flag<br>
Bit 5 = Not used<br>
Bit 4 = (H)Half Carry Flag<br>
Bit 3 = Not used<br>
Bit 2 = (P/V)Parity or Overflow Flag<br>
Bit 1 = (N)Subrtract Flag<br>
Bit 0 = (C)Carry Flag
</p>

The sign flag is simply a copy of the 7th bit of the result of a math 
Z80 instruction. However with some 16bit instructions it will be a copy 
of the 15th bit of the resulting operation.<br>
The zero flag is set when the result of an operation is zero<br>
The Half carry flag is set if a subtract operation carried from bit 4 to
 bit 3 or, or with an 16 bit operation carried from bit 12 to 11. With 
addition operations it is set if carried from bit 3 to 4 or with 16 bit 
addition 11 to 12<br>
The Parity or Overflow flag has two meanings. Some instructions use the 
parity flag which means it gets set if the result of the operation has 
an even number of bits set. The overflow flag is used by some 
instructions when the 2-complement of the result does not fit within the
 register<br>
The subtract flag is simply set when the instruction is a subtraction<br>
The carry flag is set when the instruction overflows its upper or lower limits.<br><br>

I shall show how to emulate the settings of some of these flags when I show some opcode emulation examples below.<br><br>

<u>Program Counter and Stack Pointer</u><br>

The program counter points to the address of the next opcode in memory 
to execute. The stack pointer points to the next address space where a 
value that gets added to the stack is stored. The stack works down the 
address space, it is initialized to address 0xDFF0 so if a value is 
pushed on to the stack, this is the address it gets added to and the 
stack pointer gets decremented to 0xDFEF. Popping values off the stack 
will increment the stack pointer and return the value found at the new 
position.<br><br>

Because the z80 address space is 0x10000 in size (0x0-0xFFFF) both the 
program counter and the stack pointer need to be a WORD in size.<br><br>

<u>Emulation of the Z80</u><br>
As previously mentioned the program counter and the stack pointer are 
both words in size but so are the refresh register and the interrupt 
register. These can easily be emulated with the following declarations:

<p class="code">
WORD m_ProgramCounter<br>
WORD m_StackPointer<br>
WORD m_RegisterR<br>
WORD m_RegisterI
</p>

There are many ways to emulate the registers in code. One of the ways is
 to represent each of the register pairs with a word variable and supply
 a function for retrieving the hi and lo bytes for the individual 
registers. Another way is the opposite and have 8 byte variables for 
each register and then supply a function to combine these to form a word
 to represent the pairings. However I prefer to use unions to emulate 
the registers like so: 

<p class="code">

union Register<br>
{<br>

&nbsp; WORD reg ; <br>
&nbsp; struct <br>
&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE lo ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE hi ;<br>
&nbsp; };<br>

};<br><br>

Register m_RegisterAF ;<br>
Register m_RegisterBC ; <br>
Register m_RegisterDE ; <br>
Register m_RegisterHL ; <br>
Register m_RegisterAFShadow ;<br>
Register m_RegisterBCShadow ; <br>
Register m_RegisterDEShadow ; <br>
Register m_RegisterHLShadow ; <br>
Register m_RegisterIX ;<br>
Register m_RegisterIY ;
</p>

Each field in a union occupies the same region in memory. So if you did 
m_RegisterAF.reg = 0xAABB then m_RegisterAF.hi would equal 0xAA and 
m_RegisterAF.lo would equal 0xBB.
You could then do m_RegisterAF.lo = 0xCC and m_RegisterAF.hi would still
 be 0xAA but m_RegisterAF.reg would be 0xAACC. This is perfect for 
representing the registers because
it gives easy access to the individual registers (with hi and lo fields)
 and also as a pair (with reg field). You may be wondering why BYTE lo 
is declared before BYTE hi. This
is due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">endianess</a> and you may have to declare hi before lo.

<p></p>


<h3><b>Instructions:</b></h3>
<p>
As previously mentioned the program counter points to the next opcode in
 memory to execute. 
The program counter is initialized to 0x0. The SMS will get the next 
opcode from memory, execute the opcode and then increment the program 
counter so it points to the next opcode to execute. However I prefer to 
emulate this by retrieving the next opcode from memory and then 
immediately incrementing the counter before executing the opcode. I do 
this because the call and jump instructions set the program counter, so I
 dont wish to then increment the program counter after the call and jump
 instruction have set it.

</p><p class="code">

int Z80::ExecuteNextInst( )<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_OpcodeCycles = 0 ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE instruction = ReadMemory(m_InternalMemory[m_Context.m_ProgramCounter]) ; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_ProgramCounter++ ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ExecuteOpcode(instruction) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; assert(m_Context.m_OpcodeCycles &gt; 0) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; reurn m_Contex.m_OpcodeCycles ;<br>
}

</p>

The m_Context variable is just a huge structure containing all the 
variables I use for emulating the Z80 like the registers, program 
counter etc. It also has an integer called m_OpcodeCycles which gets set
 to the amount of Z80 clock cycles the executed instruction takes. The 
assert is a nice way of detecting if any of my emulated instructions has
 forgotten to set its cycle count. <br><br>

The ExecuteOpcode function takes the opcode as a parameter and will 
emulate the z80 opcode. It just contains a big swith statement which 
looks up what the opcode is meant to do and emulates it. Using the 
opcode table that I linked to on the "Resource" section of the SMS 
tutorials I can give the following snippet of how the ExecuteOpcode 
function behaves:

<p class="code">
void Z80::ExecuteOpcode(BYTE opcode)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; IncrementRegR() ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; switch (opcode)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0x0: m_Context.m_OpcodeCycle = 4 ; break ; // no-op<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0x8: Exchange(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.reg, m_Context.m_RegisterAFShadow.reg); break;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0x87: ADD_8BIT(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.hi, m_Context.m_RegisterAF.hi) ; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0xC9: RETURN( ) ; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0xBE: COMPARE(ReadMemory( m_Context.m_RegisterHL.reg) ); break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0xCB: ExecuteCBOpcode( ) ; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; default: assert(false); break ; // unhandled opcode<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
}
</p> 

This is just a snippet of the switch statement as the real thing has a 
few hundred cases. Hopefully if you use that hex opcode resource I 
mentioned you should understand all of the switch block. As I mentioned 
earlier the R register is incremented everytime an opcode or an opcode 
prefix is read, however once the lower 6 bits or the r register reaches 
127 then the lower 6 bits of the r register are all set to 0.<br><br>

<u>Opcode Prefixes:</u><br>
Because the Z80 opcodes are a byte in size there are only 256 possible 
instructions that can be used. However the developers got round this by 
using opcode prefixes. Opcode 0xCB is an opcode prefix this means that 
the next instruction is read from memory and this value represents a 
different instruction. For example if the opcode 0x8 is read from memory
 when executed this instruction means "Exchange AF with AFShadow". 
However if instruction 0xCB is read then another opcode is immediately 
read, and if this new opcode was 0x8 it would not be the exchange 
instruction, it would be a "RRC" instruction. This way by using opcode 
prefix 0xCB the developers now had access to an extra 256 instructions 
because they could reuse the values. Once again look at that Opcode hex 
values resource I link to in the "Resource" section of this site and 
look at how opcode 0x8 in the first table (the standard opcode table) 
means "EX AF,AF'" and now look at the second table (the CB prefix table)
 and notice how opcode 0x8 is "RRC b". This means our ExecuteCBOpcode 
function which I've used in that switch block above can be implemented 
like this:

<p class="code">
void Z80::ExecuteCBOpcode()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE opcode = ReadMemory(m_InternalMemory[m_Context.m_ProgramCounter]) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_ProgramCounter++; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; IncrementRegR() ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; switch (opcode)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0x8: RRC(m_Context.m_RegisterB.hi); break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; default: assert(false); break ; // unhandled opcode<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
}
</p>

Hopefully the above code snippet helps claifry the prefixes. There are 
more opcode prefixes that behave in the same way to the 0xCB prefix. 
These are called 0xED,0xDD,0xFD. The first one 0xED has its own unique 
opcodes like 0xCB does and these can be found on the same resouce as I 
mentioned above. The 0xDD and 0xFD are quite strange. These prefix 
behave EXACTLY the same as the standard opcode with the exception that 
where registers HL were used before we now need to use registers IX for 
prefix 0xDD and registers IY for prefix 0xFD. For example standard 
opcode 0x2B is "DEC HL", so opcodes 0xDD 0x2B is "DEC IX". There is just
 one further catch though. If the standard opcode referred to a memory 
address with HL (you can tell because the opcode will show HL in 
brackets like (HL) ) then the same goes for IX and IY but an 8 bit 
offset is added onto the IX and IY addresses. For example standard 
opcode 0xBE is "CP (HL)" whereas prefix opcode 0xFD 0xBE is "CP 
(IY+offset)". The offset is simply the next byte in memory that the 
program counter is pointing to, however it needs to be treated as a 
SIGNED BYTE.

<p class="code">
void Z80::ExecuteDDOpcode()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE opcode = ReadMemory(m_InternalMemory[m_Context.m_ProgramCounter]) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_ProgramCounter++; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; IncrementRegR() ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; switch (opcode)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0x2B: DEC(m_Context.m_RegisterIX); break; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0xBE: COMPARE(ReadMemory( GetIXIYOffset(m_Context.m_RegisterIX)) ); break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; default: assert(false); break ; // unhandled opcode<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
}<br><br>

WORD Z80::GetIXIYAddress(WORD ixiy)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; SIGNED_BYTE offset = ReadMemory(m_InternalMemory[m_Context.m_ProgramCounter]) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_ProgramCounter++; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; return ixiy + offset ;<br>
}

</p>

As you can see the compare instruction argument is the IX register plus 
the offset (which is retrieved from GetIXIYAddress function) and is used
 as an address for the ReadMemory function. If you look at this 
implementation for opcode 0xBE compared to the one I gave earlier in the
 standard opcode switch block, hopefully it makes sense.<br><br>

Of course with all rules there are a few exceptions. "JMP (HL)" does not
 have the offset added to it for 0xDD and 0xFD prefixes, so it is 
"JMP(IX)" and "JMP (IY)". Also the "EX DE,HL" instruction is not 
affected by the 0xDD and 0xFD prefixes (meaning HL stays as HL).<br><br>

<u>Flag awareness</u><br>
There are a few opcodes which behave differently based on the current 
flag status. For example "JMP z" will jump to a specific address if the z
 flag is set, otherwise it will not jump. Similary "CALL nc" will call a
 function if the carry flag isnt set, otherwise it will not call. Be 
aware that these instructions carry with them a different clock cycle 
count if it goes one way or another. To get the opcodes clock cycle 
count look at the T-States of the Sean Young documentation "Z80 info" in
 the resource section of my site.<br><br>

You will also notice that there are few peculiar instructions like "JMP 
m" and "CALL pe". This is what the following letters mean:

<p class="block">
m = S flag is set <br>
po = P/V flag is off<br>
p = S flag is off <br>
pe = P/V flag is set
</p>

<p></p>

<h3><b>Opcode Examples:</b></h3>
<p>
Now we have the switch blocks setup it is time to emulate the functions 
they call. In our first switch statement the EXCHANGE function is 
called, and this is its implementation:

</p><p class="code">

void Z80::Exchange(WORD&amp; ex1, WORD&amp; ex2)<br>
{<br>
WORD temp = ex1 ;<br>
ex1 = ex2 ;<br>
ex2 = temp ;<br>
m_Context.m_OpcodeCycle = 4; <br>
}

</p>

The above Exhange function shows how to emulate the Z80 exchange 
instructions, it can be used for EX AF, AF' aswell as the other exchange
 instructions.<br><br>

The next function shows how to emulate the JR (jump immediate 
instruction). There are two types of JR instructions, the first type 
will always jump and the second type will only jump if a certain 
condition is true. We can emulate it like this: 

<p class="code">

void Z80::CPU_JUMP_IMMEDIATE(bool useCondition, int flag, bool condition)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_OpcodeCycle= 12 ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!useCondition)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIGNED_BYTE n = (SIGNED_BYTE)ReadMemory(m_Context.m_ProgramCounter) ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_ProgramCounter += n;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else if (TestBit(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo, flag) == condition)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIGNED_BYTE n = (SIGNED_BYTE)m_Context.ReadMemory(m_Context.m_ProgramCounter) ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_ProgramCounter += n ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_OpcodeCycle= 7 ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_ProgramCounter++ ;<br>
}

</p>

So the above function will jump always if no condition is used, 
otherwise it will test the condition (tests whether a flag is set or not
 set) and if so it jumps or doesnt jump. Notice how the opcode cycle 
counter is set lower if it doesnt jump? This is because it never reads 
from memory which would require more clock cycles.<br><br>

The next example shows how the 8 bit decrement function works. It 
decrements the register being passed as an argument then sets all the 
flags.

<p class="code">

void Z80::CPU_8BIT_DEC(BYTE&amp; reg, int cycles)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_OpcodeCycle = cycles ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE before = reg ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; reg-- ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // set z flag if result is negative<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (reg == 0)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo = BitSet(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo, FLAG_Z) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo = BitReset(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo, FLAG_Z) ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // set h flag if lower nibble is 0, meaning it will carry from bit 4<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if ((before &amp; 0x0F) == 0)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo = BitSet(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo, FLAG_H) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo = BitReset(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo, FLAG_H) ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // v is calculated not p<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (before == -128)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo = BitSet(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo, FLAG_PV) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo = BitReset(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo, FLAG_PV) ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // set subtract flag<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo = BitSet(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo, FLAG_N) ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // set sign flag to bit 7 of the result<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (TestBit(reg,7))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo = BitSet(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo, FLAG_S) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo = BitReset(m_Context.m_RegisterAF.lo, FLAG_S) ;<br>
}
