<p> Sega Master System - Memory.</p>

</div>

<div id="main">

<h3><b>Memory Map:</b></h3>
<p>

The SMS address space is really quite simple compared to other video 
games systems (like the gameboy). The following is the memory map:

</p><p class="block">
0x0000-0x3FFF : ROM Slot 1<br>
0x4000-0x7FFF : Rom Slot 2<br>
0x8000-0xBFFF : Rom Slot 3 / RAM Slot<br>
0xC000-0xDFFF : RAM<br>
0xE000-0xFFFF : Mirrored RAM
</p>

When the game is initialized rom page 0 should be in slot0, page 1 
should be in slot 2 and page 2 should be in slot 3. It is important to 
remember that even though these pages can be swapped in and out at any 
point the first 0x400 bytes of slot 1 does not get paged out. This is 
because the interupt handler routines are at this address space and they
 need to always be present so interupts can get handled correctly. This 
means that address range 0x0-0x400 is always data of page0 0x0-0x400<br><br>

You cannot write to address range 0x0-0x8000 this is because this region
 is for read only memory. You can only page data in and out of this 
area. However slot 0x8000-0xBFFF (Slot 3) is also treated as read only 
memory unless one of the two RAM banks is paged in there. This will be 
discussed later.

<p></p>

<h3><b>Memory Mappers:</b></h3>
<p>
As stated above the ROM address spaces have 3 0x4000 byte slots 
available for the game memory. The third of these slots can also be used
 to page in a ram bank. There are two 0x4000 ram banks available. 
Different games have different amounts of rom pages available. The rule 
of thumb is the bigger the game the more pages that it can choose from. <br><br>

The memory mapping registers are address 0xFFFC-0xFFFF<br><br>

0xFFFC: Memory Control Register<br>
0xFFFD: Writing a value to this address maps that values page into slot 1<br>
0xFFFE: Writing a value to this address maps that values page into slot 2<br>
0xFFFF: Writing a value to this address maps that values page into slot 3<br><br>

I will discuss the memory control Register in a moment. The other three 
registers are responsible for
causing the paging of memory in and out of their respective slots. So 
writing the value 0 to address 0xFFFE will result in page0 being paged 
into slot2. Writing the value 0xA to 0xFFFD will result in page10 being 
paged into slot1 with the exception of the first 0x400 bytes being not 
paged because as mentioned earlier you cannot page the first 0x400 bytes
 out of slot1. Writing to address 0xFFFF usually maps a rom page to slot
 3 however depending on the Memory Control Register it may end up being 
ignored if RAM banking in slot 3 is enabled. RAM banking always takes 
priority over ROM banking.<br><br>

Because of RAM mirroring writing to address range 0xDFFC-0xDFFF mirrors 
over the mapping registers 0xFFFC-0xFFFF. I personally do not mirror 
address 0xDFFC-0xDFFF over memory control registers 0xFFFC-0xFFFF as 
this has given bad results.

</p>

<h3><b>Memory Control Register:</b></h3>
<p>
Different bits in the Memory Control Register data byte (address 0xFFFC)
 represent different settings for how the mapper is controlled. Although
 all known software only ever uses bit 2 and 3. If bit 3 is set then RAM
 is mapped into Page Slot 3 which will always override any rom banking 
there. If bit 3 is not set the rom banking will happen in slot 3. If ram
 banking is enabled then bit 2 of 0xFFFC selects which of the 2 ram 
banks gets banked into slot 3. If the bit is "1" then the second ram 
bank is used, otherwise the first.<br><br>

Although the memory control register can have further uses, because no 
games use them I shall not discuss them as I did not waste my time 
emulating them.

</p>

<h3><b>Writing to Memory:</b></h3>
<p>
There are many Z80 instructions which result in data being written to 
memory. It is good practice to always use the one function call when 
writing to memory, this way it will be easy to trap memory access and 
monitor it. This way we can make sure no data is written to ROM, we can 
also make sure mirroring is handled correctly aswell as handing paging 
instructions. The following is how I handle writing to memory:

</p><p class="code">

void Emulator::WriteMemory(const WORD&amp; address, const BYTE&amp; data)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; // handle the codemasters memory mapping<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (m_IsCodeMasters)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (address == 0x0 || address == 0x4000 || address == 0x8000)<br>		
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoMemPageCM(address,data) ;	<br>	
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // cant write to rom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (address &lt; 0x8000)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // allow writing here if a ram bank is mapped into slot 3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else if (address &lt; 0xC000)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE controlMap = m_InternalMemory[0xFFFC] ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (m_CurrentRam &gt; -1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_RamBank[m_CurrentRam][address-0x8000] = data ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // this is rom so lets return<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // it looks ok to write to memory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; m_InternalMemory[address] = data ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // handle standard memory paging<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (address &gt;= 0xFFFC)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (!m_IsCodeMasters)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoMemPage(address, data) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // handle mirroring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (address &gt;= 0xC000 &amp;&amp; address &lt; 0xDFFC)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_InternalMemory[address+0x2000] = data ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (address &gt;= 0xE000)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_InternalMemory[address-0x2000] = data ;<br>
}


</p>

Ignore the codemasters section at the top for now and lets concentrate 
on the rest. The first thing to check for is if the game is trying to 
write to ROM slots 1 or 2. If it is then we immediately return because 
the game cannot write here. We then check to see if the game is trying 
to write to slot 3. We can only allow writing to slot 3 if a ram bank is
 enabled there so we need to check the memory control register at 
address 0xFFFC. If Ram is banked into slot 3 then write to the ram bank 
and exit, otherwise we must exit because if Ram isnt banked there then 
rom is so we cannot write there. If the game is not attempting to write 
to any of the 3 slots then we allow writing to ram and then check if we 
need to handle memory paging which is the function called DoMemPage. 
Once the memory paging is done we finally handle ram mirroring. 
Hopefully that seemed simple enough.

<p></p>

<h3><b>Memory Paging:</b></h3>
<p>
Now we know how memory paging works lets see how to implement it. The 
data being written to the paging registers contains the page number to 
use. All games use bits 5-0 of the data byte to get the page number with
 exception of the 1megabyte games wich use bits 6-0. Once we know the 
page number we need to store this for the correct slot so when reading 
from the slots we know which page to read from. For example if the page 
number is 5 and the game is writing to address 0xFFFE then page 5 is 
mapped into slot 2. It would be nice and easy to just memcpy the data 
from page5 into slot 2 but this would be slow
so it is better to just have a variable called m_SecondBankPage and set 
it to 5. This way whenever the game
tries to read from slot 2 we can use this variable as a lookup to find 
the correct page in the cartridge memory to return the correct value.<br><br>

The only other part left to handle is writing to the memory control 
register (0xFFFC). We need to update the current ram bank if this 
register gets written to. 

</p><p class="code">

void Emulator::DoMemPage(WORD address, BYTE data )<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE page = m_OneMegCartridge?data &amp; 0x3F: data &amp; 0x1F ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; switch(address)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0xFFFC:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // check for slot 2 ram banking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (TestBit(data,3))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // which of the two ram banks are we swapping in?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TestBit(data,2)?m_CurrentRam = 1 : m_CurrentRam = 0 ;	<br>				
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else	<br>			
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_CurrentRam = -1 ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0xFFFD: m_FirstBankPage = page ; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0xFFFE: m_SecondBankPage = page ; break ; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0xFFFF:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // only allow rom banking in slot 2 if ram is not mapped there!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (false == TestBit(context-&gt;m_InternalMemory[0xFFFC],3))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m_ThirdBankPage = page ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
}


</p>

<p></p>


<h3><b>Memory Paging - CodeMasters:</b></h3>
<p>
The codemasters game use their own mapper which luckily for us is 
simpler than the standard sega mapper. First of all there is no ram 
banking so only rom is
mapped into slots 1-3. Also there is no need to protect address 
0x0-0x400 in slot1 as this can be paged in and out by the mapper. The 
mapper doesnt use registers 0xFFFC-0xFFFF to manage the mapper. Instead 
it uses registers 0x0, 0x4000 and 0x8000. Writing to address 0x0 pages 
slot 1, writing to 0x4000 pages
slot 2 and writing to 0x8000 pages slot 3. Apart from this the mappers 
are identical which gives us the following implementation

</p><p class="code">

void Emulator::DoMemPageCM(WORD address, BYTE data ) <br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; BYTE page = m_OneMegCartridge?data &amp; 0x3F: data &amp; 0x1F ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; switch(address)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0x0: m_FirstBankPage = page ; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0x4000: m_SecondBankPage = page ; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case 0x8000: m_ThirdBankPage = page ; break ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
}

</p>
 
<p></p>

<h3><b>Reading From Memory:</b></h3>
<p>
For the same reason that we want to control writing to memory we also 
need to control reading from memory. I have already shown the memory map
 the z80 address space, however I could of shown it in the more basic 
form of: <br><br>

0x0000-0xBFFF: Cartridge Memory<br>
0xC000-0xFFFF: RAM<br><br>

So when ever the z80 tries to read from memory it will always read from 
its internal memory. Remember that the majority of rom sizes are larger 
than 0xC000 bytes in memory so the entire rom cannot fit in the 
Cartridge memory address region. This is why paging is needed so the 
correct rom memory can be in the cartirdge memory address region when 
needed. This means the Sega Master System always reads from internal 
memory whether it wants to read cartridge memory or RAM and it needs to 
do memory paging to make sure the correct cartridge memory is available.<br><br>

I personally emulate this differently than how the SMS works. Instead of
 memcpy'ing the the cartridge memory to internal memory whenever a page 
change occurs I just store a variable of the new page that is active. 
Then whenever the Rom tries to read from the cartridge memory address 
space inside the internal memory I just lookup the data directly from 
the cartridge memory. The reason why I do this is to avoid any slow 
memcpy's. This then led me to write the following ReadMemory function:



</p><p class="code">
BYTE Emulator::ReadMemory(const WORD&amp; address)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; WORD addr = address ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // read from mirror 0xDFFC-0xDFFF not the memory map registers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (addr&gt;=0xFFFC)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addr-=0x2000 ;<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; // the fixed memory address in slot 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else if (!m_IsCodeMasters &amp;&amp; (addr &lt; 0x400))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return m_InternalMemory[addr] ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; // slot 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else if (addr &lt; 0x4000)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // convert address to correct page address<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsigned int bankaddr = addr + (0x4000 * m_FirstBankPage) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return m_CartridgeMemory[bankaddr] ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; // slot 2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else if (addr &lt; 0x8000)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // convert address to correct page address<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsigned int bankaddr = addr + (0x4000 * m_SecondBankPage) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // remove offset<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bankaddr-=0x4000 ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return m_CartridgeMemory[bankaddr] ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; // slot 3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else if (addr &lt; 0xC000)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // is ram banking mapped in this slot?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (m_CurrentRam &gt; -1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  return m_RamBank[m_CurrentRam][addr-0x8000] ; // 0x8000 offset<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // convert address to correct page address<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsigned int bankaddr = addr + (0x4000 * m_ThirdBankPage) ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // remove offset<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bankaddr-=0x8000 ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return m_CartridgeMemory[bankaddr] ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; return m_InternalMemory[addr] ;<br>
}
</p>

At first the above code looks a bit peculiar and I guess it is. What you
 need to remember that the page variables represent a 0x4000 block of 
memory in the cartridge memory. So page 0 starts at address 0x0 in the 
cartridge memory and page 2 starts at address 0x8000 (0x4000 * 2). This 
is how we find the correct page in memory, which is what the bankaddr 
variable is for. You will notice that for slot 2 and 3 the bankaddr 
variable has an offset removed from it. Remember that each page is 
0x4000 bytes and we only want to read one of these bytes. If we wanted 
to read byte 0x50 in slot 1 then we simply return bankAddr + 0x50 with 
no offset for slots 1 page. However if we wanted to read byte 0x4050 
this is essentially saying i want to read byte 0x50 from slot 2. This is
 why 0x4000 is removed from the bank address. Lets have another example.
 To read the 0xA byte from slot 3 the address would be 0x800A. So we get
 the correct page by doing addr + (0x4000 * m_ThirdBankPage) to give us 
the START point of that page. The address is 0x800A, the 0x8000 part has
 been used to determines the slot and from this we can determine the 
page (bankaddr), we then need to determine what byte in this page is 
being referenced. The answer is 0x800A - 0x8000 which is 0xA. This is 
why the offset is used.<br><br>

Using this method whenever the game needs to do a memory read from ROM 
it will always return the correct data from the current page in the 
respective slot. If reading outside the slot area (0xC000 - 0xFFFF) then
 we return from the internal z80 address space (internal memory) and 
from from cartridge memory.<br><br>

You will also notice that whenever I read from slot 3 I check to see if I
 need to read from ROM (Cartridge memory) or a RAM bank. <br><br>
